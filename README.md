# Odin Recipes

This is a practie poject as I follow along with The Odin Project and learn web development. It's a simple website built in HTML (no CSS or Javascript just yet) with a homepage that links to three recipe pages.

As I've completed this project, I've practiced creating html pages with images, links, headers, and a basic file structure.
